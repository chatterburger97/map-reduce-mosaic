# map-reduce-mosaic
Target image construction from very large image dataset

###Two working solutions : 
	master : cluster small images into colour clusters using k-means and spark
	map-reduce-better-bucketing : bucket smaller images into buckets corresponding to a tile colour

###Work in progress:
map-reduce-solution : didn't want to throw the code away, kept as a different branch
